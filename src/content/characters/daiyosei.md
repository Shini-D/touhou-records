Daiyousei is a lesser-known but widely recognized fairy who resides near the Misty Lake, usually seen accompanying Cirno. Though not much is officially known about her, fans have given her a sense of identity through fanworks and interpretations. Her name, which translates to “Great Fairy,” was never officially given by ZUN but has been widely accepted in the community. Daiyousei is typically portrayed as gentle, kind, and more reserved than her friend Cirno, often acting as a balancing influence. She lacks any recorded dialogue in the games, making her a blank slate for fan speculation and creativity.

In Gensokyo’s setting, Daiyousei represents the class of fairies that go unnoticed, living quietly in nature and generally avoiding conflict. While she doesn’t engage in any major incidents, she’s become something of a mascot for the everyday magic that permeates the world. Daiyousei is typically portrayed as somewhat more mature than Cirno, sometimes acting as a caretaker or big sister figure. The lack of canonical material has made her a staple of fan fiction and fan comics, where she often plays roles that explore the quieter side of Gensokyo life.

Daiyousei appeared as a mid-boss in Stage 2 of Touhou 6: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil. While she does not have a major role in the games or speak any lines, her presence alongside Cirno in that game gave her enduring recognition. She has not reappeared in official games since, but her influence lives on in fan-made games, comics, and music. In a fandom where minor characters often become stars, Daiyousei stands as a testament to the creative power of the Touhou community, symbolizing the everyday magic and tranquility of Gensokyo.
