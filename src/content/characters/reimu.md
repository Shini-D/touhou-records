Hakurei Reimu is the central protagonist of the Touhou Project series and serves as the shrine maiden of the Hakurei Shrine, located on the border between Gensokyo and the outside world. Reimu is tasked with maintaining the balance between humans and youkai and resolving any incidents that might threaten the stability of Gensokyo. Despite this immense responsibility, she is known for her easygoing, sometimes indifferent personality. She doesn’t train particularly hard, yet she possesses extraordinary spiritual power and intuition. Her calm demeanor and unshakable composure in the face of danger make her a reliable problem-solver, even if she would rather spend her days drinking tea and sweeping the shrine steps than fighting supernatural beings.

In Gensokyo, Reimu is something of a neutral party. Because of her duties as the shrine maiden, she often finds herself acting as a mediator between factions, investigating and resolving incidents regardless of who is behind them. She has formed connections with many of the other characters—human and youkai alike—even if some of those relationships are more adversarial than friendly. Her spiritual abilities include flying, exorcism, the use of yin-yang orbs, and manipulating barriers and boundaries, the latter of which connects her to the mysterious power of Yukari Yakumo. Reimu also possesses the ability to float away from reality itself, a cryptic but canonically noted power that seems to reflect her detachment and unique role within the world of Gensokyo.

Reimu first appeared in Touhou 1: Highly Responsive to Prayers, released for the Japanese PC-98 in 1997, and has appeared in every single mainline game since then, usually as a playable character. From Embodiment of Scarlet Devil (Touhou 6) onward—marking the transition to Windows—she solidified her role as the primary character of the franchise. She’s featured in numerous print works, such as Wild and Horned Hermit and Silent Sinner in Blue, and plays a lead or supporting role in fighting games like Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, Hopeless Masquerade, and Antinomy of Common Flowers. Reimu represents the spiritual and thematic center of the Touhou universe: a blend of mysticism, tradition, and unshakable calm in a world that is otherwise chaotic and filled with supernatural beings.
