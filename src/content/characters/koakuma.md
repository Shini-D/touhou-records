Koakuma, whose name literally means "little devil," is a minor character who serves as an assistant to Patchouli Knowledge in the Scarlet Devil Mansion’s library. Like Daiyousei, Koakuma has no official dialogue or elaborate backstory, but she has become a popular figure within the fandom due to her mysterious presence and potential. She is often depicted as a diligent, loyal, and slightly mischievous demon who helps Patchouli manage her massive collection of magical tomes. Her design—characterized by bat-like wings and a maid-like dress—suggests a demonic origin, but nothing is confirmed in canon.

Within the Scarlet Devil Mansion, Koakuma likely plays a support role, assisting with magical experiments, research, and bookkeeping. Given Patchouli’s sickly disposition and reclusive lifestyle, Koakuma’s assistance could be critical in maintaining the daily functions of the library. Fanworks often portray her as a foil to Patchouli’s seriousness, adding humor and a touch of chaos to the otherwise quiet, dusty confines of the mansion. Her personality varies across interpretations—from a competent assistant to a bumbling troublemaker—but she is nearly always depicted as friendly and loyal.

Koakuma appears as a mid-boss in Stage 4 of Touhou 6: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, during the approach to Patchouli's lair. Despite her minor role, she has gained a cult following in the fandom, with countless pieces of fan art, stories, and games featuring her. She hasn’t reappeared in any official capacity since EoSD, but like Daiyousei, her popularity has remained strong thanks to the creative freedom the community has taken with her undefined personality and background. In many ways, Koakuma embodies the potential hidden in even the smallest corners of Gensokyo.
