Izayoi Sakuya is the head maid of the Scarlet Devil Mansion and the only known human in the mansion's staff. She is known for her unflinching loyalty to Remilia Scarlet and her unparalleled skill in time manipulation. Cool, composed, and highly competent, Sakuya is able to stop or slow time entirely, allowing her to carry out tasks with near-superhuman precision. She also has an arsenal of knives that she uses both for combat and everyday tasks. Though she plays the role of a perfect maid, Sakuya’s background is mysterious—her origins, real name, and how she came to serve Remilia are all unknown.

As Remilia's most trusted servant, Sakuya manages the mansion’s affairs and keeps its chaotic residents in check. She is particularly strict with Meiling and diligent in handling intrusions—especially those from Marisa. Despite her apparent stoicism, fan portrayals often show Sakuya with subtle wit or a mischievous side, especially in her interactions with Patchouli or Koakuma. Her control over time makes her one of the most powerful humans in Gensokyo, yet she remains loyal to a vampire and lives among youkai. This paradoxical situation fuels much of the intrigue surrounding her character.

Sakuya debuted as the Stage 5 boss and Stage 8 mid-boss in Touhou 6: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, and she is a recurring playable character in many games, including Perfect Cherry Blossom, Imperishable Night, Double Dealing Character, and Touhou 17.5: 100th Black Market. She also appears in Immaterial and Missing Power and Scarlet Weather Rhapsody. In manga like Eastern and Little Nature Deity, she plays both comic and serious roles, often balancing grace and strength. Sakuya is a fan favorite thanks to her iconic design, her mysterious past, and her ability to stop time—a power that never ceases to fascinate.
