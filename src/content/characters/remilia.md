Remilia Scarlet is the mistress of the Scarlet Devil Mansion and one of the most prominent vampires in Gensokyo. Though she appears as a young girl, Remilia is actually over 500 years old and possesses incredible strength, speed, and the terrifying ability to manipulate fate. Despite her monstrous nature, she carries herself with elegance and refinement, often dressing in aristocratic fashion and maintaining an air of nobility. Her pride and charisma command respect from her subordinates, especially Sakuya, Patchouli, and Meiling, who serve her loyally. Remilia seeks to present herself as a cultured and dignified leader, though her immaturity and capriciousness often peek through.

In Gensokyo, Remilia plays the role of a powerful but unpredictable youkai whose influence stretches beyond her mansion's walls. While she generally keeps to herself, she has been involved in major incidents, most notably the Scarlet Mist Incident, in which she blanketed the land in red mist so that she could walk in daylight. Her power to manipulate fate is ambiguous, often leaving others unsure whether their misfortunes were caused by her or simply attributed to her influence. Still, she doesn’t exhibit the malevolence that some expect from a vampire; she prefers elegance, games, and decadence over destruction. Though proud, Remilia is deeply afraid of loneliness and often acts out to attract attention and admiration.

Remilia debuted as the Stage 6 boss and Extra mid-boss in Touhou 6: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, and she’s appeared in several other games, including Immaterial and Missing Power, Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, and Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom. She is also a major character in the manga Silent Sinner in Blue and Touhou: Cheating Detective Satori. As one of the most iconic characters in the series, Remilia has become a staple of the Touhou fandom, often portrayed with dramatic flair or comedic arrogance. Her complex blend of elegance, power, and vulnerability makes her one of ZUN’s most enduring creations.
