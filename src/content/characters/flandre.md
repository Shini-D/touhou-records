Flandre Scarlet is the younger sister of Remilia Scarlet and a vampire who lives in the basement of the Scarlet Devil Mansion. Despite being over 495 years old, she behaves with the unpredictability and emotional intensity of a child. Flandre is incredibly powerful, possessing the terrifying ability to "destroy anything" by targeting the eye of its "embodiment"—a power so abstract and destructive that even the residents of the mansion are wary of letting her outside. As a result, she has spent most of her existence locked in the mansion's basement, leading to her eccentric, lonely, and volatile behavior. Her wings, unlike her sister’s, are adorned with multicolored crystals, giving her a striking and unsettling appearance.

In the context of Gensokyo, Flandre represents the consequences of unchecked power and isolation. While she is not evil, her mental instability and lack of social interaction make her a wild card. She’s shown to be deeply curious and eager to experience the world beyond the basement, but her lack of understanding of others' boundaries makes her dangerous. Some fan interpretations depict her as sad and misunderstood, a victim of her own strength and the fear it inspires. Despite being feared, Flandre is not malicious by nature. She simply lacks the emotional development and experience to use her immense power wisely.

Flandre first appeared as the Extra Stage boss in Touhou 6: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, where she serves as one of the most iconic and challenging fights in the series. Though she hasn’t appeared as a playable character in the official games, her legacy lives on through music themes like "U.N. Owen Was Her?", which has become one of the most recognizable Touhou songs. She also makes appearances in fan works, doujin games, and print material such as Silent Sinner in Blue. Flandre remains one of the most beloved characters in the Touhou fandom due to her tragic charm, overwhelming power, and the mystery that surrounds her life in the mansion.
