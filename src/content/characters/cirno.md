Cirno is a whimsical and bold ice fairy who resides near the Misty Lake and is known for her childlike personality and exaggerated sense of strength. She proclaims herself to be the strongest, a claim that has ironically become one of her most defining traits and an enduring meme within the Touhou fandom. Cirno is impulsive, curious, and easily distracted, often acting on whims without much foresight. Her powers allow her to manipulate cold and ice, which she uses to freeze frogs, rivers, and even her enemies in battle. While fairies in Touhou are typically portrayed as weak and easily defeated, Cirno often punches above her weight, showing surprising tenacity and creativity when pushed.

Within the world of Gensokyo, Cirno represents the playful and carefree nature of the fairies who inhabit it. Despite her status as a minor being compared to youkai and humans, she frequently gets caught up in events far beyond her level, often due to her own antics. Her boldness and refusal to admit defeat make her something of a symbol of underdog perseverance. Cirno’s actions rarely have serious consequences, but her repeated appearances and her knack for stirring up harmless trouble have made her one of the more recognizable faces in the series. Her relationships with other fairies, especially the "Three Fairies of Light" (Sunny Milk, Luna Child, and Star Sapphire), often revolve around pranks and light-hearted mischief.

Cirno first appeared in Touhou 6: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil as the Stage 2 mid-boss and boss, and later reappeared in Perfect Cherry Blossom, Phantasmagoria of Flower View, and Double Spoiler. She starred as the main character in Touhou 12.8: Great Fairy Wars, where she fights her way through other fairies in a quest for revenge. Her playable appearances include Phantasmagoria of Flower View and Antinomy of Common Flowers. Despite being a “minor” character in terms of power, Cirno’s popularity and frequency of appearances have made her an essential part of the series' charm and humor.
