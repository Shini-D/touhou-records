Patchouli Knowledge is a magician who lives in the Scarlet Devil Mansion and serves as its resident librarian. With a frail body but immense magical knowledge, Patchouli is one of the most powerful magicians in Gensokyo. She has mastered elemental magic tied to the five classical Chinese elements (wood, fire, earth, metal, and water) and light and darkness, often combining them in sophisticated spellcards. Due to chronic asthma and anemia, she rarely leaves the mansion, preferring to remain in her massive, dimly lit library, studying and reading. Her introverted and contemplative nature makes her a perfect fit for the role of a shut-in scholar.

Patchouli is known for her logical thinking and calm demeanor, but she can be short-tempered, especially when dealing with disruptionsâ€”like Marisa stealing books. She acts as a grounding influence within the Scarlet Devil Mansion and is one of the few characters capable of challenging Remilia in intellect. Despite her physical frailty, her magical prowess makes her a formidable opponent. She tends to avoid unnecessary fights, but when provoked, she can be devastating, using elaborate multi-element spells that overwhelm her enemies. Her relationships with Koakuma, Remilia, and Sakuya highlight her role as an academic surrounded by chaos.

Patchouli first appeared as the Stage 4 boss in Touhou 6: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil and returned in several later games, including Imperishable Night, Subterranean Animism, and Touhou 17.5: 100th Black Market. She is also a playable character in the fighting games Scarlet Weather Rhapsody and Antinomy of Common Flowers. Beyond the games, Patchouli appears frequently in official manga, such as Inaba of the Moon & Inaba of the Earth and The Grimoire of Marisa. Her blend of magical complexity, frailty, and sardonic wit makes her one of the more unique personalities in the series.
