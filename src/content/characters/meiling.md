Hong Meiling is the Chinese-themed gatekeeper of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, stationed at its outer gates. She is known for her bright outfit, long red hair, and martial arts fighting style. Despite being a youkai, she is rarely taken seriously due to her habit of falling asleep on the job or letting intruders—like Marisa—sneak past her. Meiling’s exact species is unknown, though she may be a youkai with ties to dragons, as some of her spellcards suggest draconic influences. Her character is cheerful, patient, and loyal, often depicted smiling even when being scolded by Remilia or Sakuya.

As the mansion’s front-line defender, Meiling is technically the first challenge anyone faces when trying to get inside. She’s strong, agile, and able to manipulate qi energy, which she uses in her elegant, martial arts-inspired danmaku. In fan portrayals, Meiling is often the “punching bag” of the mansion, frequently mocked or mistreated by other residents, especially in humorous comics. However, she is also shown to be incredibly resilient, good-natured, and wise—sometimes taking on a mentoring or big sister role in the fandom. Her laid-back attitude and physical discipline contrast nicely with the more intellectual or mystical characters of the Scarlet Devil Mansion.

Meiling made her debut as the Stage 3 boss in Touhou 6: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, and later appeared in Immaterial and Missing Power and Scarlet Weather Rhapsody as a playable character. She also makes frequent appearances in fan-made games and manga, and she’s one of the more beloved background characters in the fandom. While she may be underestimated by the more powerful figures of Gensokyo, Meiling’s strength, warmth, and unwavering dedication have made her a fan favorite.
