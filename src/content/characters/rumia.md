Rumia is a low-level youkai who controls darkness. She appears in Touhou 6: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil as the Stage 1 boss and is notable for being the first enemy in the Windows era of Touhou. Despite her ominous-sounding power, Rumia is portrayed as simple-minded and not particularly dangerous. She often floats around with a ball of darkness surrounding her, which ironically blinds her as much as anyone else. This makes her more of a comic relief character in the fandom, as she has trouble seeing where she's going and can even crash into trees.

Within Gensokyo, Rumia plays a minor role, but she serves as a kind of baseline example of what a youkai can be: not necessarily malevolent, but mischievous, hungry, and mysterious. While her darkness manipulation sounds threatening, she rarely uses it effectively and seems more interested in wandering around aimlessly than causing real harm. Some interpretations cast her as secretly more powerful than she lets on, hinting that her aloof demeanor might mask something more ancient and sinister, but canonically she’s just a very basic threat.

Besides Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, Rumia appears in Double Spoiler and 100th Black Market as an opponent. Though her official roles have been small, she’s maintained a steady fan following due to her meme-worthy quotes (“I’m the darkness!”) and goofy charm. Rumia often shows up in comics, parodies, and music videos, where her playful, hungry nature is played up for laughs. She represents the kind of character that makes Touhou so unique—someone with a neat concept and a lasting presence despite having almost no backstory or development in the games themselves.
