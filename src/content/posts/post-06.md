Touhou’s cast draws heavily from Japanese mythology and folklore, with characters based on youkai, spirits, gods, and legends. From the vampiric Scarlet sisters to the nine-tailed fox Ran Yakumo, the series is a deep dive into fantastical interpretations of traditional tales.

What’s fascinating is how ZUN blends myth with original concepts, creating characters that feel familiar yet fresh. Some are centuries-old spirits while others are quirky inventions like Nitori, a tech-savvy kappa who loves gadgets and machines.

This mythological grounding gives Touhou its distinctive flavor. The characters aren’t just random designs—they have history, personality, and often a deeper meaning rooted in cultural tradition.
