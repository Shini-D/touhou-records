Touhou’s core gameplay revolves around the “danmaku” or bullet hell genre, where players must dodge intricate patterns of projectiles while returning fire at bosses. What sets Touhou apart is the elegance and creativity of these patterns, often described as beautiful or mesmerizing.

Each boss character has their own unique attack style, turning each fight into a visual dance of bullets and spells. The use of color, movement, and rhythm turns gameplay into a kind of performance art, challenging players both mechanically and aesthetically.

ZUN’s minimalist approach to programming and design has given Touhou its distinct charm. While the graphics are modest, the gameplay is tight and rewarding. The real magic lies in the patterns—and the satisfaction of surviving them.
