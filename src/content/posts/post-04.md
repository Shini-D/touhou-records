One of the Touhou Project’s most enduring features is its music. Composed solely by ZUN, the soundtracks blend classical, jazz, rock, and traditional Japanese influences into catchy, emotional tracks that are beloved by fans worldwide.

From the upbeat tones of “Bad Apple!!” to the powerful melodies of “Necrofantasia” and “UN Owen Was Her?”, Touhou’s music has inspired countless remixes, covers, and even full orchestral arrangements. It’s not uncommon for fans to discover Touhou through its music alone.

ZUN’s compositions not only enhance the atmosphere of each stage and boss fight, but also give emotional weight to the characters and their stories. Even without cutscenes, the music conveys the intensity and mood of each moment.
