The Touhou Project is a long-running series of Japanese bullet hell shooter games developed by a single person known as ZUN. Since the release of the first game in 1997, the franchise has grown into a massive multimedia phenomenon, inspiring fan games, music remixes, comics, and more.

Set in the fantastical land of Gensokyo, a place hidden away from the modern world, the series features a diverse cast of mostly female characters with magical powers, mythical origins, and eccentric personalities. Players often take on the role of shrine maiden Reimu Hakurei or magician Marisa Kirisame to resolve supernatural incidents threatening the peace.

What makes Touhou truly unique is its grassroots nature. The fandom thrives on creativity, with a near-endless stream of doujin (fan-made) content that continues to evolve and expand the universe beyond the official games. It’s more than just a game—Touhou is a cultural movement.
