At the center of the Touhou universe stands Reimu Hakurei, the ever-reluctant but powerful shrine maiden of the Hakurei Shrine. She’s tasked with maintaining the delicate balance between humans and yokai in Gensokyo, often through force when diplomacy fails.

Reimu is known for her easygoing nature, preferring tea and naps to conflict. However, when an incident arises, she’s usually the first on the scene, guided by her strong spiritual powers and unwavering sense of duty. Her iconic red and white outfit and floating yin-yang orbs make her a recognizable figure in the series.

Despite her central role, Reimu rarely seeks recognition or reward, making her an intriguing protagonist. Her interactions with other characters often highlight her blunt honesty and surprisingly dry sense of humor.
