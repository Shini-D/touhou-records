Despite being an indie series made by one man, Touhou has stood the test of time. With over 20 mainline games and a massive fanbase, its impact on indie gaming and otaku culture canâ€™t be overstated.

Touhou is a testament to the power of passion and community. ZUN never chased fame or profit; he simply created a world he loved, and others followed. The lack of corporate interference has kept the series authentic and true to its roots.

Whether you're here for the music, the characters, the fanworks, or the gameplay, there's always something new to discover in Gensokyo. Touhou continues to inspire because it invites everyone to be part of the magic.
